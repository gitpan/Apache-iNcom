Changes in Apache::iNcom 0.08 Mar 30 2000

- New configuration directive : INCOM_SESSION_SERIALIZE_ACCESS

    If you set this directive to 1, only one request by session will 
    be processed simultaneously. This is necessary if you are using
    frames and your database doesn't support full serializable
    transaction isolation level, so that one request overwrites changes
    made in the other request. 

    You will need to add a field locked_by of type INT to your 
    sessions table.


- Periodic garbage collection of of expired sessions.

- New input filters : 

	integer, pos_integer, neg_integer, 
	decimal, pos_decimal, neg_decimal,
	phone, dollars, quotemeta, uc, lc, ucfirst,
	sql_wildcard.

- Bug fixes :

    - Important bug fixes in the processing of input filters.
